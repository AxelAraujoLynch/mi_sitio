            <p class="ms-1"> HISTORY <br> Linkin Park was founded by three high school friends: Mike Shinoda, Rob
              Bourdon, and Brad Delson. The three attended Agoura High School in Agoura Hills, California, a suburb of
              Los Angeles. After graduating from high school, the three began to take their musical interests more
              seriously, recruiting Joe Hahn, Dave "Phoenix" Farrell, and Mark Wakefield to perform in their band, then
              called Xero. Though limited in resources, the band began recording and producing songs within Shinoda's
              makeshift bedroom studio in 1996, resulting in a four-track demo album, entitled Xero, released in
              November 1997. However, tensions and frustration within the band grew after they failed to land a record
              deal. The lack of success and stalemate in progress prompted Wakefield, at that time the band's vocalist,
              to leave the band in search of other projects. Farrell also left to tour with Tasty Snax, a Christian punk
              and ska band.

              After spending a considerable time searching for Wakefield's replacement, Xero recruited Arizona vocalist
              Chester Bennington, who was recommended by Jeff Blue, the vice president of Zomba Music in March 1999.
              Bennington, formerly of a post-grunge band Grey Daze, became a standout among applicants because of the
              dynamic in his singing style. The band then agreed on changing their name from Xero to Hybrid Theory; the
              newborn vocal chemistry between Shinoda and Bennington helped revive the band, inciting them to work on
              new material.
              In 1999, the band released a self-titled extended play, which they circulated across internet chat-rooms
              and forums with the help of an online "street team".

              The band still struggled to sign a record deal. They turned to Jeff Blue for additional help after facing
              numerous rejections from several major record labels. After failing to catch Warner Bros. Records on three
              previous reviews, Blue, who was now the vice president of Warner Bros. Records, helped the band sign a
              deal with the company as a developing artist in 1999. However, the label advised the band to change their
              name to avoid confusion with Hybrid. The band considered the names "Plear" and "Platinum Lotus Foundation"
              before deciding on "Linkin Park", a play on and homage to Santa Monica's Lincoln Park, now called
              Christine Emerson Reed Park. They initially wanted to use the name "Lincoln Park", however they changed it
              to "Linkin" to acquire the internet domain "linkinpark.com".

              Bennington and Shinoda both reported that Warner Bros. Records was skeptical of Linkin Park's initial
              recordings. The label's A&R was not pleased with the band's hip-hop and rock-style approach. An A&R
              representative suggested that Bennington should demote or fire Shinoda and exclusively focus on making a
              rock record. Bennington supported Shinoda and refused to compromise Linkin Park's vision for the album.
              Farrell returned in late 2000, and the band released their breakthrough album, Hybrid Theory, that same
              year. <br>


              <br> HISTORY pt2 <br>
              Linkin Park released Hybrid Theory on October 24, 2000 The album, which represented half a decade's worth
              of the band's work, was edited by Don Gilmore. Hybrid Theory was a massive commercial success; it sold
              more than 4.8 million copies during its debut year, earning it the status of best-selling album of 2001,
              while singles such as "Crawling" and "One Step Closer" established themselves as staples among alternative
              rock radio play lists during the year. Additionally, other singles from the album were featured in films
              such as Dracula 2000, Little Nicky, and Valentine. Hybrid Theory won a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock
              Performance for the song "Crawling" and was nominated for two other Grammy Awards: Best New Artist and
              Best Rock Album.[25] MTV awarded the band their Best Rock Video and Best Direction awards for "In the
              End".[6] Through the winning of the Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance, Hybrid Theory's overall success
              had catapulted the band into mainstream success.

              During this time, Linkin Park received many invitations to perform on many high-profile tours and concerts
              including Ozzfest, Family Values Tour, and KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas. The band worked with Jessica
              Sklar to found their official fan club and street team, "Linkin Park Underground", in November 2001.
              Linkin Park also formed their own tour, Projekt Revolution, which featured other notable artists such as
              Cypress Hill, Adema, and Snoop Dogg. Within a year's stretch, Linkin Park had performed at over 320
              concerts. The experiences and performances of the precocious band were documented in their first DVD, Frat
              Party at the Pankake Festival, which debuted in November 2001. Now reunited with former bassist Phoenix,
              the band began work on a remix album, dubbed Reanimation, which would include works from Hybrid Theory and
              non-album tracks. Reanimation debuted on July 30, 2002, featuring the likes of Black Thought, Jonathan
              Davis, Aaron Lewis, and many others. Reanimation claimed the second spot on the Billboard 200, and sold
              nearly 270,000 copies during its debut week. Hybrid Theory is also in the RIAA's Top 100 Albums.
